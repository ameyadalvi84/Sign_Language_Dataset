# Sign_Language_Dataset
Sign Language Dataset

Data - 18.6.2020

My first try on Sign Language Dataset.
Learnings
1. Learning rate had to decay as the model was giving 99% accuracy on train nad validation data set after few epochs ~4. After 4 epochs the accuracy would almost drop to 0.04.
2. Reduced the hidden layers in my data model.
3. Need to focus on EDA as there is not data for label 9 yet it is present in the output.

Need to improve over all presentation and start with EDA and use seaborn for plotting.
